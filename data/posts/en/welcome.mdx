Hi everyone, I'm [AdriÃ¡n Serrano](http://twitter.com/adrserr10), I'm a Front-End Developer and this is my brand new web ðŸ˜„.
Some months ago I started this website. I thought it was about time to have a place where I have the possibility to share/store my knowledge and to have a playground where I can experiment with anything I am keen on.

Motivated by some friends I began building this blog. Finally, I decided to use Next.js (thanks to [Lucas](https://lucasbernalte.com/) for his guidance). When I first started I was new to Next.js and SSR, to SEO, to web performance, etc., so this has been a long journey. I have learned a lot since the first day, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. I will be happy to share it with you.

## What I have used?

Just to summarize it, I will make a list:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a must-have in all projects)
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) (I want to write in Spanish and English)
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) (to create and render blog posts)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) (the open source alternative to firebase)

## Why a blog?

Well, this is a very important question. Why should I have a blog? The web is plenty of blogs, some of them of outstanding quality, of renowned professionals.

In my case, this is a way of improving my soft skills. For example, by having this blog I want to push myself to write what I have learned. This will be like my public second ðŸ§ . Is faster and easier to go to your notes instead of googling something you already knew but you have forgotten. You will always understand better your own words.

Additionally, as you gain more experience, you will need to write more (emails, documents, documentation) and for me, this has always been my worst skill. So one of my goals is to improve my writing abilities both in English and Spanish. Yes, I want to write in both languages to reach as many people as possible. I am a native Spanish speaker and there is far less content written in Spanish so I want to help change this.

Another important point, it is worth mentioning is that this serves as my personal portfolio. This web shows who I am and what I can achieve. Maybe this can be the difference for your future interviewer.

Last but not least, I always start projects to try new technologies, but I always left them before finishing. Having my website is a fantastic place to play with every idea I have or any new thing I want to test. This is my personal playground ðŸ™‚.

## Inspiration

To create this site I have inspired in my friend [Lucas Bernalte](https://lucasbernalte.com/) blog and [Lee Rob](https://leerob.io/) web. As I have already mentioned I was staring from scratch learning Next.js so these sites has been incredibly helpful.

## What's next?

Honestly? I don't know.

I will try to share how I created this site, and what problems I have suffered. Some of them stupid because of my lack of knowledge, others complex because of being used to Client-Side Apps.

I hope you find my story useful and I have motivated you to create your own site.

See you on my next post.

Thanks, AdriÃ¡n.
